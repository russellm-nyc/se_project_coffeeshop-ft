Project name: _Coffee Shop Website_
This website showcases the specialty coffee served at Triple Peaks Library. It includes YouTube videos demonstrating a variety of home-brewing recipes, a table reservation form, and an up-to-date menu of their current coffee offerings.

Key skills used in building the site include CSS, BEM refactoring, menu card styling, form building and interactive animations.

I would love to incorporate some of the more dynamic animation techniques we learned in Sprint 2.
